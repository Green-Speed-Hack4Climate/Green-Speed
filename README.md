# GREEN SPEED
## Description
Program that helps users plan eco-friendly transportation means by analysing and predicting traffic frequency and suggesting optimal travel times for less traffic congestion and reduction in individual carbon foorprint by reducing volume of vehicle emissions per unit of time.
## Demo
(Screenrecording/Screenshots of the program in action)

## Technical working
A motorway traffic dataset from Luxembourg was analysed using Python on Google Colab and insights gained from the data i.e Vehicle-flow over time and how the variables correlate. Feature engineering was deployed to determine what features we will use in the data to perform modelling and model performance for better accuracy.
