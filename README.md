# GREEN SPEED
## Description
Program that helps users plan eco-friendly transportation means by analysing and predicting traffic frequency and suggesting optimal travel times for less traffic congestion and reduction in individual carbon foorprint by reducing volume of vehicle emissions per unit of time.

## Technical working
A motorway traffic dataset from Luxembourg was analysed using Python on Google Colab and insights gained from the data i.e Vehicle-flow over time and how the variables correlate. Feature engineering was deployed to determine what features we would use in the data to perform modelling and model performance for better accuracy. Using two machine learning models for regression and classification we were able to come up with a model that could predict based on a specific highway, what times are optimal for motorists to drive on that would reduce the amount of time spent in traffic therefore then reducing net emissions and thus lowering carbon footprint.
